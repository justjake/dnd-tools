dnd-tools
=========

Exceedingly simple Dungeons and Dragons tooling.

Right now the only thing here is the `pathfinder-dnd-tools` gem, a companion program to the excellent 
[Google Drive character sheet][1]. The Pathfinder gem hooks up to your Google Drive character sheet to 
pull in your stats. It's just a quick little dice-rolling and skill-checking console.

All log-in stuff is handled by OAuth, so there's absolutely no funny business.
